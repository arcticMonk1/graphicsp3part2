VERTICES
click      to select closest
mouse-drag to move
d          to delete closest
i & click  to inserts at mouse
e/E        to perturn a little/lot
=          to copy real vertex set R into saved vertex set S
S          to   switch to editing the saved set
R          to switch to editing the real set
g/G        to get (load) vertices from data.pts / from named file
w/W        to write (save) vertices to data.pts / to named file
;/:        to perturb vertices a little/a lot (if nt live, use m afterwards to recompute mesh)
C      to use content of clipboard as folder name for saving pictures


BALLS * PILLARS
B         to show/hide balls

MESH
l         to toggle live mode where the mesh is recmputed at each frame or only when m or 1 & 2 are pressed
m         to recompute mesh in non-live mode
T         to show/hide triangles
V         to show/hide Voronoi edges
^         to show/hide current corner of mesh
b         to smoothen interior vertices
